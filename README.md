## About

A better logger for Node.js that logs timestamp, date and time of logs along with colors to make debugging easier in large scale.

Used in many of my projects like [Giveaway Boat](https://giveaway.boats) to help me track down errors and logs easier.

## How To Use?
It's very simple to use, simply import the package and that's all!

## Example
```js
import 'better-logger';

console.log('This is a log!'); // [14/11/2022 11:39:02 pm 1668449342517] This is a log!
console.error('An Error!'); // [14/11/2022 11:39:02 pm 1668449342517] An Error!
```
